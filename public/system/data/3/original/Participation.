T2 Social Work Education
AB The quasi-experimental study reported in this paper examined whether students were more satisfied and learned more using an online discussion with peers or a hardcopy reflection with one-time feedback from the facilitator/instructor. A t-test was used to measure the difference between an experimental section and a comparison section of the same course on: post-course ratings of how well the course objectives had been achieved, what students hoped to gain from the course, satisfaction with the course, and student end-of-the-semester grades. Students in the group who participated in the weekly online discussions with peers indicated higher rates of accomplishing what they hoped to gain from the course than those who turned in weekly hardcopy reflections with one-time feedback from the facilitator/instructor. Students expressed a preference for the method of reflection used in their course section. However, the students' ages emerged as an important variable in their preference for online discussion. There was significant difference between the groups on ratings of how well the course objectives had been achieved, but not in satisfaction with the course, or course grades.

T1 Recognising and promoting collaboration in an online asynchronous discussion
A1 Murphy, Elizabeth
T2 British Journal of Educational Technology
AB This paper reports on a study involving the identification and measurement of collaboration in an online asynchronous discussion (OAD). A conceptual framework served for the development of a model which conceptualises collaboration on a continuum of processes that move from social presence to production of an artefact. From this model, a preliminary instrument with six processes was developed. Through application of the instrument to an OAD, the instrument was further developed with indicators added for each process. Use of the instrument to analyse an OAD showed that it is effective for gaining insight into collaborative processes in which discussants in an OAD do or do not engage. Use of the instrument in other contexts would test and potentially strengthen its reliability and provide further insight into the collaborative processes in which individuals engage in OADs. Analysis of an OAD using the instrument revealed that participants engaged primarily in processes related to social presence and articulating individual perspectives, and did not reach a stage of sharing goals and producing shared artefacts. The results suggest that the higher-level processes related to collaboration in an OAD may need to be more explicitly and effectively promoted in order to counteract a tendency on the part of participants to remain at the level of individual rather than group or collaborative effort.

T1 Fostering knowledge construction in university students through asynchronous discussion groups
A1 Schellens, Tammy
A1 Valcke, Martin
T2 Computers & Education
AB Does collaborative learning in asynchronous discussion groups result in enhancing academic discourse and knowledge construction? This general research question has been researched in a study involving 300 students, working during six months in 38 electronic discussion groups. The transcripts of the discussions were coded and analysed to test hypotheses related to the impact on knowledge construction. Coding of the units of analysis was based on the models of Fahy, P. J., Crawford, G., Ally, M., Cookson, P., Keller, V., & Prosser, F. (2000). The development and testing of a tool for analysis of computer mediated conferencing transcripts. Alberta Journal of Educational Research, 46(1), 85-88 and Veerman, A., & Veldhuis-Diermanse E. (2001). Collaborative learning through computer-mediated communication in academic education. In P. Dillenbourg, A. Eurelings, & K. Hakkarainen (Eds.), European Perspectives on Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning. Proceedings of the First European Conference on CSCL. Maastricht: McLuhan Institute, University of Maastricht. The results confirm that students in the discussion groups are very task-oriented and that higher proportions of high phases of knowledge construction are observed. Significant increases in the cognitive interaction, task-orientation and higher phases of knowledge construction are detected. Group size is a significant interaction variable. Discussion in smaller groups reflects larger proportions of higher levels of knowledge construction. The results point at the critical impact of structure in the task environment. In the discussion section, methodological issues are presented. The article concludes with directions for future research and some implications for instructional practice.

T1 User Generated Content in the Newsroom: Professional and Organisational Constraints on Participatory Journalism
A1 Paulussen, Steve
A1 Ugille, Pieter
T2 Westminster Papers in Communication & Culture
AB The phenomenon of citizen journalism and the wider trend of user generated content are creating new challenges and opportunities for mainstream media. Traditional news media, like newspapers, tend to show increasing interest in the ways in which user generated content can be integrated into the professional news making process. Yet, scarce but growing research on participatory journalism suggests that the adoption of user generated content in the newsroom is hindered by several contextual factors on different levels of the newsroom organisation. By taking a social constructivist approach to examine the development of participatory journalism, we have tried to gain a better understanding of what these factors are and how they shape the adoption of user generated content. Empirical evidence was sought through twenty semistructured interviews with the newsroom staff of two Belgian newspapers and one local community website. One of our main conclusions is that participatory journalism is developing rather sluggishly; however this is often due to newsroom structures, work routines and professional beliefs rather than unwillingness among professionals to open up the news production process to user contributions.

T1 Interactivity in the daily routines of online newsrooms: Dealing with an uncomfortable myth
A1 Domingo, David
T2 Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication
AB This article analyzes interactivity in online journalism as a powerful myth with which journalists have to deal in their daily work. A constructivist approach to media innovation is used to explore the historical origins of the myth that predicted interactivity would change journalism and to confront it with the actual practices of online media projects through published empirical research and four case studies selected from an average European regional market. The analysis of the cases is based on ethnography of online newsrooms working routines and in-depth interviews with reporters, editors and web developers. The actual role of the myth of interactivity in shaping the development of these four online news projects is discussed taking into account the material and organizational context of the newsrooms. Findings suggest that the professional culture of traditional journalism has a strong inertia in the online newsrooms that prevents them from developing most of the ideals of interactivity, as they do not fit in the standardized news production routines.

T1 A collaborative writing approach to wikis: Design, implementation, and evaluation
A1 Hadjerrouit, Said1
T2 Issues in Informing Science & Information Technology
AB Wikis provide teachers with potentially significant opportunities for creating socially engaged tasks that require active student participation and collaboration. Wikis allow students to work together to develop content on the web, giving them a sense of how writing can be carried out collaboratively. Collaborative writing offer opportunities not only to practice literature review, academic reading and writing, but also to stimulate reflection, knowledge sharing, and critical thinking. However, despite the potential capabilities of wikis, true collaborative writing does not work by itself as the research literature clearly reveals. To foster collaborative writing, participation, and active involvement in wiki development, there is a need for a systematic approach to the construction of wikis. The aim of this paper is to allow students to develop wiki applications using a collaborative writing development approach based on rapid prototyping. The paper also reports on the evaluation of the approach by means of qualitative data collection and analysis methods. Finally, the implications of the approach for collaborative writing are critically discussed according to a set of requirements associated with software development considerations and pedagogical issues.

T1 Compulsory participation in online discussions: is this constructivism or normalisation of learning?
A1 Gulati, Shalni1
T2 Innovations in Education & Teaching International
AB A constructivist approach in teaching and learning requires one to change various habitual ways for thinking (von Glasersfeld 1995). There is a need for different ways of thinking and doing things, if conventional education is to realise a constructivist worldview. Educators and trainers in both academic and work sectors are promoting the use of the Internet for flexible and learner-centred learning. The intention of this paper is to examine the popular online learning pedagogy and question if the emerging formal higher education practices advocate a constructivist view of knowledge. The discussion begins with an introduction to the constructivist view. Although participation in online discourse is popularly recognised as social constructivism, the problematisation and critique of online practices help to challenge the formal education interpretation of constructivism. References to the emerging research and established literature on learning are used to identify the normalising influences of academic courses that require compulsory participation in online discussions. The choice to learn in silence is discussed in reference to the power differences influencing online discussion participation. The emerging online pedagogy is challenged for its limited appreciation of diverse learning preferences that is a central aspect of constructivism. The conclusion of the paper draws from data analysis in the author's doctorate study, which is in progress. It proposes how online and offline educators who aim for learner-centred and constructivist learning could use the insights gained from this analysis.

It describes the project as working ‘along the grain’ of current technology and educational culture since it aims to exploit the capabilities of the ICT used (e.blackboard1) in ways which could be enacted in schools today whilst at the same time giving due attention to modify the constraints of time, place and hierarchy that the ICT revolution threatens in schools. Quantitative and qualitative results are discussed. The relationship between ICT and the wider social, political and cultural context is also discussed. The paper concludes with areas for further research and points to the need to review current assessment cultures in schools.

AB Abstract
Social interactions to supplement learning and asynchronous tools to facilitate exchange of quality ideas have gained much attention in information systems education. While various systems exist, students have difficulty with deep processing of complex instructional materials (e.g., concepts of a theory and pedagogical support mechanisms derived from a theory). This research proposes a theoretical framework that leverages attention guidance in a social constructivist approach to facilitate processing of central domain concepts, principles, and their interrelations. Using an open source anchored discussion system, we designed a set of instructor-based and peer-oriented attention guidance functionalities involving dynamic manipulation of text font size similar to tag clouds. We conducted an experimental study with two small groups of first-year doctoral students in a blended-learning classroom format. Students in the control group had no access to attention guidance functions. Students in the treatment group used instructor-based attention guidance functionality and then switched to peer-oriented attention guidance functionality. The evaluation compared focus, content, and sequential organization of students' online discussion messages with heat maps, content analysis, sequential analysis, and statistical discourse analysis to examine different facets of the phenomenon in a holistic way. The results show that in areas where students struggle to understand challenging concepts, instructor-based attention guidance functionality facilitated elaboration and negotiation of ideas, which is fundamental to higher order thinking. In addition, after switching to peer-oriented attention guidance functionality, students in the treatment group took the lead in pinpointing challenging concepts they did not previously understand. These findings indicate that instructor-based and peer-oriented attention guidance functionalities offer students an indirect way of focusing their attention on deep processing of challenging concepts in an inherently open learning environment. Implications for theory, software design, and future research are discussed.

AB Advances in technology are having a profound impact on distance education as online learning is becoming a preferred educational option. Within these online learning experiences, the asynchronous online discussion has evolved into one of the most commonly used communication tools. However, a lack of cognitive processing and interaction in the discussions appears to limit the potential benefits as suggested within social constructivist theories. This research analyzed participant responses and postings in online discussions and identified seven stances relative to collaboration and cognitive engagement of participants. A taxonomy was created that allows categorization of participant stances with respect to the two constructs. Implications for teaching and research are presented with attention to facilitative prompts, which are used to enhance collaboration and participation within online discussions.

It considers the role of the tutor and discusses the extent to which online discussions can facilitate social constructivist approaches to instruction and the creation of knowledge. Participants were 17 trainee teachers studying on a post graduate teaching course. The asynchronous text-based discussion (using e-blackboard) focused on planning for progression in children's learning in history and culminated in the trainee teachers writing individual assignments on the topic. The paper analyses the different types of contributions made and reports on the trainees' evaluations of the benefits and limitations of using e-blackboard. It concludes with recommendations and areas for further research.

T1 Collaborative learning in asynchronous discussion groups: What about the impact on cognitive processing?
A1 Schellens, Tammy
A1 Valcke, Martin
T2 Computers in Human Behavior
AB Does working in a Computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environment, and more specific, working in “asynchronous electronic discussion groups”, have an impact on cognitive processing? This general research question has been researched in a study involving 230 freshmen taking the course “educational sciences”. During four months, students were working in 23 discussion groups on collaboration tasks based on authentic situations and problems. The transcripts of eight groups were randomly selected and analysed. A variety of content analysis models was adopted to ground theoretical assumptions about the value of collaborative learning environments. The messages were coded building on the models by Veerman and Veldhuis-Diermanse (2001) and Gunawardena, Lowe, and Anderson (1997). The theoretical basis of the study integrates the models in a conceptual framework, building on the information processing approach to knowledge construction and social-constructivist principles. The results confirm that interaction in the discussion is very task-oriented, stays task-oriented and reflects high phases in knowledge construction. Clear results can be presented about the impact of the amount of discussion activity on the nature and quality of the discussions and the phases of knowledge construction. In the discussion section, methodological issues are presented. The research points at a number of methodological issues and directions for future research.

AB This qualitative study explores how using Peer Learning Forums (PLF) in an online asynchronous computer programming course can be analyzed to derive information about Student Activity Focus (SAF) for adult Information Technology students. Three instruments are proposed to assist instructors classify questions posted by students on these forums, obtain easy quantitative measures of their SAF, and use it to gain a better understanding of the type of learning barriers they are encountering. In addition, we also look at the difference in SAF between passing and failing students based on their exam performance. The PLF learning activity and the classification instruments are easily adaptable to other disciplines or courses and allow instructors and students alike to gain a better understanding of what kind of participation is helpful in online asynchronous discussion forums.

T1 The Socratic dialogue in asynchronous online discussions: Is constructivism redundant?
A1 Kingsley, Paul
T2 Campus - Wide Information Systems
AB Purpose - This paper aims to examine Socratic dialogue in asynchronous online discussions in relation to constructivism. The links between theory and practice in teaching are to be discussed whilst tracing the origins of Socratic dialogue and recent trends and use of seminar in research based institutions. Design/methodology/approach - Many online degree courses employ asynchronous discussions where the teacher, acting as a moderator, is seen as the guide on the side rather than the sage on the stage. Such an approach, employing collaborative learning, is often described as constructivist. Practitioners may see the term constructivist as simply a convenient label to describe a range of effective teaching practices. Even when it is said that knowledge is constructed, this may be viewed as little more than a metaphor. There are however, behind these labels, epistemological theories such as radical constructivism and social constructivism which pose serious challenges to traditional views that perception is guided by contact with an independent reality and that science involves a search for objective truth. Many significant philosophical objections can be raised against these theories. The links between the theory and teaching practices of proven value are tenuous. There is an alternative explanation of the origins of teaching practices associated with asynchronous discussions. Findings - Asynchronous discussion makes it possible for all students to make an initial written contribution based on both research and industry experience, as well as an extensive participation in a written debate. The relative ease of assessing contributions to a written debate helps overcome the problem of the seminar where only one person may get credit for his or her contribution. Contributions can to a great extent be made when it is convenient for both moderator and students. Research limitations/implications - The present study has considered the case of one institution; it will be useful to examine it for many. Practical implications - Asynchronous online discussion is one of the highest forms of Socratic dialogue. Originality/value - This is a different approach to the traditional belief and new ideas for consideration are presented. The Socratic dialogue has been developed as both an oral and written tradition from the works of authors like Plato, through to the development of the medieval university with its disputations and oral examinations, the introduction of seminars in research based universities inspired by Humboldt, the development of scholarly journals, and on to the asynchronous online discussions in the era of the Web.

T1 COGNITIVE AND SOCIAL CONSTRUCTIVISM: DEVELOPING TOOLS FOR AN EFFECTIVE CLASSROOM
A1 Powell, Katherine C.Kalina
T2 Education
AB An effective classroom, where teachers and students  are communicating optimally, is dependent on using  constructivist strategies, tools and practices. There  are two major types of constructivism in the classroom: (1) Cognitive or individual constructivism depending on Piaget's theory,  and (2) Social constructivism depending on Vygotsky's theory. Similarities include inquiry teaching methods and students  creating concepts built on existing knowledge  that are relevant and meaningful. Differences include language development theory where thinking precedes language for cognitive constructivism and language precedes thinking for the theory of social constructivism. Understanding communicative tools and strategies helps teachers to develop individual learning methods such as, discovery learning, and social interactive activities to develop  peer collaboration.
