<ab>In this study, novel methods were developed for the in-vivo high-resolution recording and analysis of small intestine bioelectrical activity, using flexible printed-circuit-board (PCB) electrode arrays. Up to 256 simultaneous recordings were made at multiple locations along the porcine small intestine. Data analysis was automated through the application and tuning of the Falling-Edge Variable-Threshold algorithm, achieving 92% sensitivity and a 94% positive-predictive value. Slow wave propagation patterns were visualized through the automated generation of animations and isochronal maps. The methods developed and validated in this study are applicable for use in humans, where future studies will serve to improve the clinical understanding of small intestine motility in health and disease.
